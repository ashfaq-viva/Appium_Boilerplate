### How to run the project and once the above link is understood, here is a short summary to go check

Use Intellij or Aqua 

Step-1: To run the project, execute below command as shown below

    install node: install Node.js, visit the official Node.js download section.

Once the installation is complete, restart the terminal and run the command -> node â€“version again. It will return the Node version.

This indicates the successful installation of Node.js. The Node.js installation also covers the installation of npm (node package manager).

Mac users can use the node -v and npm -v commands to verify the installation and version details.

To install Appium, run the following command.

    npm install -g appium

The command above will download and install Appium. Once done, verify the Appium installation on macOS or Windows by running the command below:

    appium --version

This will return the latest Appium version installed in your system.


    1. you can run individual tests or multiple tests at a time from testng.xml file.
    2. you can run using groups eg mvn test -Dgroups=sanitySuite
    3.you can run each test from test page

### How It Works?
Test script sends a command (e.g., "Tap this button").

Command is sent to the Appium server at the remoteURL via an HTTP request.

Appium server processes the request and interacts with the device.

Response is sent back to the test script.

Without the remoteURL, the test framework wouldn't know where the Appium server is running and could not initiate or control the test session.
